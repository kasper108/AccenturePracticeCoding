// During the day, please try to build some chat app, base requirements: server and client side.
// E.g. You can run the application (acting as a server), which listens for the client app to join.
// It can be as simple as 2 terminal apps you can run from the command line/IntelliJ.
// If you find that easy, feel free to expand and build it in Java FX, for instance.
